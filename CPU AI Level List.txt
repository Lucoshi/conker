AI Info: 05(cpus appear to behave like normal, but when they obtain weapons, AND pulls them out, and is
ABOUT to use them, they don't aim them properly, thus leading to funny, and strange things, like having
them commit suicide(if the bazooka is their weapon.). Most of these invalid AI levels are like that, because
Rare did not program them, but they're part of the AI data, so, they are in the game.)
0006-quit.
AI Info: 06(cpus appear to behave like normal, like the normal ai levels. but they still seem to have
difficulty with aiming the bazooka more properly, as they rotate a little bit back and forth. When they

the bombs though, and they also use the knife like normal.)
